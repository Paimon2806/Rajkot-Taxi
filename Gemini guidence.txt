Given your existing setup and the need to accommodate more content, my top recommendation for your app's navigation strategy is:

**1. Primary Navigation (Bottom Tabs - 3-4 items max):**

* **Home (Dashboard):** This is your anchor. It should be a personalized hub with:
    * **Quick "Find a Ride" (Passenger) / "Go Online" (Driver) buttons.**
    * **Relevant summary data:** "Your next ride," "New ride requests near you," "Recent activity."
    * **Quick links to key features:** "Post a Ride," "My Rides."
* **Rides:** This would be a single tab for all things "ride listing/Browse."
    * It will primarily show **available rides (`RideList.tsx`)** that drivers can accept.
* **My Journeys:** This new tab would consolidate all rides *relevant to the current user*, whether they are a passenger or a driver.
    * It would contain the **"My Accepted Rides" component** you just created.
    * **Crucially, this tab could have internal sub-navigation** (e.g., using a segmented control or nested tabs) for:
        * "Upcoming Rides" (accepted but not yet started)
        * "Past Rides" (completed by user)
        * "My Posted Rides" (if the user is also a passenger who posts rides)
* **Profile/Account:** For personal settings, payment methods, help, etc.

**2. Secondary Navigation (Stack Navigator - Everywhere else):**

* **From Home/Rides:** Tapping a `RideCard` (available or accepted) leads to a `RideDetailsScreen` via a stack. This screen would then have actions like "Accept," "Cancel," "Contact Passenger/Driver," "Start Ride," "Complete Ride," etc.
* **From "Post a Ride" button (on Home or in a dedicated "Post Ride" flow if not a tab):** Leads to your `ridepost` form and subsequent screens.
* **From Profile:** Leads to "Edit Profile," "Settings," "Payment Info," "Help & Support" screens.

**3. Tertiary Navigation (Drawer Navigator - Optional, but useful):**

* For global features that aren't critical to daily usage but still need to be accessible:
    * "About Us"
    * "Privacy Policy"
    * "Rate Us"
    * "Invite Friends"
    * A more comprehensive "Settings" if your profile tab is simple.

**Why this is the best for you:**

* **Clean Tabs:** Keeps your bottom bar focused on 3-4 primary user intentions (finding rides, managing their own trips, managing their profile).
* **Logical Grouping:** `My Journeys` is a smart way to collect all user-specific ride history in one place, reducing tab clutter.
* **Scalability:** The Stack Navigator allows unlimited depth for details and forms, which is where most of your content will live.
* **Clear User Flow:** Users intuitively understand that tapping a list item takes them to a detail screen, and the back button gets them out.
* **Future-Proof:** Easily allows you to add more features (e.g., driver earnings, passenger preferences, different ride types) by extending screens within the stack or adding new segments within a `My Journeys` tab.

This structure balances easy access to core features with the ability to house extensive content without overwhelming the user.
